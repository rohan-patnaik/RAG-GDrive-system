# scripts/benchmark.py
"""
Script for benchmarking the RAG system's performance.
This is a placeholder and would need to be significantly expanded.

Possible benchmarks:
1.  Ingestion speed: Time to load, process, and store a large set of documents.
2.  Query latency: Time from receiving a query to returning an LLM response.
    -   Breakdown: Embedding time, retrieval time, LLM generation time.
3.  Retrieval accuracy: Using a labeled dataset (query, relevant_doc_ids) to measure
    metrics like MRR, MAP, Recall@K for the retrieval step.
4.  End-to-end answer quality: More complex, often involves human evaluation or
    LLM-as-a-judge techniques against a Q&A dataset.
5.  Throughput: Queries per second the system can handle.
